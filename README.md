## Quantification of International Treaties


### Motivation
International cooperation has resulted in a large set of agreements and treaties. Often they are treated as qualitative information, though more systemic and in-depth analysis can help reveal rich insights. This project employs textual analysis to categorize and quantify these international treaties, and serve as an important source in illustrating the creation of international public goods to address issues such as climate change. Additionally, network analysis of such data further sheds light on the frequencies and depth of country connections.
